Task description:

Our objective is to develop a compact application leveraging React.js.
The application will serve as a dashboard, interfacing with a specified dataset.
Upon initiation, the user will be greeted with an interactive map showcasing flarestack locations. This map will be powered by Mapbox technology. Adjacent to the map, there will be a section dedicated to a Plot (time series visualization) that will dynamically represent a chosen attribute from the dataset, implemented using Plotly.js.
This Plot will feature an interactive element that allows users to select different properties to be displayed on the y-axis, prompting the Plot to adjust accordingly.
Furthermore, the map will offer the functionality to select individual flarestacks. Selecting a flarestack will trigger the Plot to update and exhibit data specific to that chosen flarestack.
